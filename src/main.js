/**
 * This is the entry module for webpack.
 * 
 * For a webpackage itself there is no need to put any code into, as 
 * all the logic is within the subfolders (representing a webapp, a component etc.).
 * But you can use this file for js function
 * 
 * So the only reason for this file to exist is the requirement of webpack for such an entry module.
